# Alohomora Cards!

This is a group project created for the JavaScript Module of **Adalab's Coding Bootcamp**.

## The Project

The goal was to develop an interactive web page using JavaScript in which users could create fun business cards by filling up a form and uploading a photo. The card displays the photo, name, job and icons to contact. There are icons for phone, email, linkedin and github, each one when clicked opens a new window with the selected way to contact.

Our group chose to base the web on the Harry Potter world. Alohomora is a spell used to open and unlock doors, which for us represents the actitud we have when it comes to life, to always overcome whatever is trying to stop you from moving forward. Alohomora! ⚡️✨

## Our goals were:

- Learn basic programming concepts (variables, data structures, conditionals, functions, etc.);
- Understand how to manipulate the DOM of a page and respond to user events;
- Handle complex data structures, with arrays and objects;
- Make requests to the server and store data locally;
- Implement Scrum as a reference framework for product development, always basing ourselves on the values ​​of Agile as key points of teamwork and continuous improvement;
- Improve communication between team members;
- Improve our communication skills in public by presenting the project in the final session;
